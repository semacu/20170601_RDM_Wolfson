### Summary

Researchers and students spend most of their time dedicated to quantitative analysis on the process of cleaning and preparing data. This class will go through some intuitive principles to organise and work with data more effectively. It will also highlight ways to plan data management early in your project and will introduce strategies to avoid data disasters.


### Contents

- What is research data?
- Why managing your data can be useful for you and others?
- Challenges
- Gaining confidence to organise your data well
- Existing resources and tools
